# (Re)Charge
A game project based on procedural content generation, (Re)Charge is about rushing to each level's exit while picking up as many energy units as possible, and dodging enemy clouds.

# Controls
WASD / Arrow keys : Move

Space : Pause
Esc : Quit (when paused)

# Rules
Each move costs one energy point (counter located on the left side of the screen), and game is over when all energy points have been exhausted. 
Avoid contact with enemy clouds: they will cause you to lose a large dose of energy.

Note: Music by Plini (Every Piece Matters).

#Changelog
v0.3 
- Added feedback for collecting  powerups / colliding with enemy clouds.
- Fixed player vanishing on reaching exit.
- Add graceful exit (press Esc when paused / when game is over).
	
v0.2
- From instadeath to permadeath.
